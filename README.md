Thoughts: I have never heard of this ongoing trial until now. I found it interesting (but not too surprising) that Google is being accused are being accused
of deliberately hindering competition that concerns their search engine. They are accused of spending billions in maintaining an unlawful monopoly that has had adverse effects on users and potential competitors. More specifically, the lawsuit claims that Google pays device manufacturers, such as Apple, Samsung, LG, etc., to make Google the default search engine on their devices. I think this just shows how competetion should be enforced because at the end of the day if competition amongst manufacturers or big tech companies exist, consumers always win.
